title: My My Miro
---

The Covid-induced remote work really had me struggling and I openly admit it.
I'm a fan of tangible stuff: post-it notes, pens, paper and people. Digital tools
tend to disrupt my concentration and it seems that especially in remote team work significant
amount of energy goes in coping with the various hurdles that accompany the constantly developing tech tools.

But luckily, development speed of tools has been pretty impressive. Within couple of years,
most annoying kinks have been ironed out and even Teams is pretty usable in most cases.
For me, the most impressive development has happened with Miro, the online whiteboard.

Here are some of my favourite use cases and some sweet [Miro](https://www.miro.com) features:

## Digital doodling

My work involves a lot of planning and thought processing and I have always enjoyed the use of whiteboards.
I doodle a lot in notebooks and all the possible paper available, but for planning, processing and understanding larger
systems not many formats are as good as whiteboards. I have had several personal ones in many of my jobs and even made one
at home from an old glass table when I did my Master's Thesis at home.

To my big disappointment, it has been really hard to get that same experience in digital world. I got iPad Pro with Apple Pen in 2018 and immediately started searching for
a tool to enable me to take the whiteboard to go: it took almost 3 years to find one. I have tested multiple note-taking apps, presentation apps and digital arts apps (with iPad, Procreate is The One), 
but they costantly lack in one or more of these areas:
- Sufficiently large working space: most apps deal with predefined limited space and scaling is pretty awkward. 
- Sharing and teamworking features: Sharing, showing and collaborating upon one artifact is The Reason to use a whiteboard. Bouncing around several versions of same document is incredibly painfull and smooth collaboration over tools
that are initially designed for single person usage(looking at you, Google Slides or Powerpoint in Teams) seems to be a challenge.
- Cross-platform compatibility: This relates to teamworking features as well, but due to Reasons, I'm forced to work with both Windows and Mac and even the best tool in the world is not good, if I can only use it on one platform.
- Drawing: Drawing features in tools tend to be either too fancy (such as in Procreate) or too simple (in most note-taking apps) to give whiteboard-like feeling.

During 2021, Miro has brought some really cool features on drawing side, especially with the tablet and pen. It provides a good variance of helpfull features such as assisted shapes in Smart Drawing, 
but it's not too complex with 150 different brushes and styles. Moving between different work modes is easy and makes the Miro experience super close to a proper whiteboard.

## Presenting without Powerpoint

Dont' get me wrong, I do not hate Powerpoint. It's has been trusty and reliable tool from my first study years back in early 2000's, but in many ways, time has not improved it. Powerpoint will most likely not loose it's position as
the corporate presentation tool, but in my opinnion, Miro makes things a bit more interesting in more informal setups with Frames.

You can use frames in multiple ways to structure the content of the board, but one of the coolest features is the Presentation mode. With it, you can navigate between frames and create a smooth, full-screen slideshow. 
Frames in Miro are much more flexible than pre-defined spaces in most slideshow presentation apps, giving the opportunity to be a bit more creative with your work. I especially enjoy the possibility to do all the content first and frame it afterwards: 
you can for example have a workshop and build a presentation for the results of that workshop afterwards, without the need to copy-paste or screenshot stuff from program to program. 
And if you need to take it to the company-branded PowerPoint, Frames support a great export to PDF where every frame is it own page.

## Flexible Sharing

I like the possibility collaborate, but I also like to be able to do my own stuff in private and control what I share. I have separate Miro-accounts for work and personall stuff anyhow, but I do like the possibilty to limit the visibilty of your boards within the same corporate account.
This enables having a private doodle board in a company account and being able to prepare, doodle and throw away content you don't feel like sharing. And when you do, you can just give a link to your team mates, customers or users, invite them to collaborate and then disable the link when it's no longer needed. 
Everyone does not need their own account and as a facilitator, you don't have to make sure everyone remembers their passwords and login emails, saving time and most likely some nerves.
