I'm interested in all things Information Systems; users and usability, data and analytics, design and implementation, planning and project co-ordination. Not that much about technologies, but more on the impact and effects the systems have on the world around them.

I might write about:
- IS research about digitalization and new technologies
- Design and usability
- Agile software development and project management
- The usuall stuff about ICT working life and stuff I wonder or like about*

*The Other Stuff I like:
Paper, inks, notebooks, pens, post-it notes and other analog art and note-taking paraphernalia. 
Books, both fiction and non-, also comics. Non-fiction books will get their own section, I love to have professional reading in paper format.
Cats, I have 2.
Photography, with my ancient Canon 5D and cheap 50mm lens.
Music, almost anything goes but synth and post-punk are the s*it.
Sports, crossfit and biking.
